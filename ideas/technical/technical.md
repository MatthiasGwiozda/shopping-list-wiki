# Technical Ideas
- Make the path to the sqlite database configurable

- Find queries, which make multiple statements and wrap them in a single transaction.
    - This issue is not critical. It might for example happen, that a category is inserted and
    not assigned to all shops. But the category could be deleted in this case.
    - The problem is that sqlite3 doesn't make it easy to implement such transactions.
    We will wait till one of this issues are resolved:
