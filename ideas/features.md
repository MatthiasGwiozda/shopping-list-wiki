# Feature Ideas
- show the ingredients on top of each recipe when generating a shopping list
  - how to show units (e.g kg)?

- Make shopping-list useable on the smartphone.
  - Let the user use the List during shopping, instead of using an external editor like google keep
  - Save the order, in which the user checks the items during shopping to create a natural order for future generation of shopping lists.

- create language - packages
  - german
  - Centralize messages
  - Some messages require dynamic elements

- use fuzzy search to find items easier
    - in editableList
    - for itemCollection.

- allow side - dishes to have side - dishes themselves. This can be useful for dips, which includes one "base sauce" for all dips: https://lieblingsgeschmack.de/5-blitz-sossen-fuer-raclette-und-fondue/

- Set an .ico - file for electron.exe after build
  - Problem: currently there is a bug in rcedit, which does shady stuff with exe - files: https://github.com/electron/electron-packager/issues/590
