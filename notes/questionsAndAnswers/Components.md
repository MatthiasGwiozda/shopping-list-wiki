# What are components?
components in this context are simple html pages with JavaScript - logic and css styles. Some of them can be accessed through the main menu of the application.

In general components are reusable pieces of code, which includes html and JavaScript.
Components may be designed to only be used once on the page. A component may be used multiple times, just like javaScript functions.

A component can use other components.
