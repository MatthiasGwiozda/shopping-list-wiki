# Why is this an Desktop app?
I find it much easier to manage shopping lists on a large screen.

Shopping lists can be easily moved to the smartphone after they were generated by this app. My favourite app is google keep.
I use google Keep as it is useable in the browser and on the smartphone.
Additionally all the data is synchronized between the devices instantly.
