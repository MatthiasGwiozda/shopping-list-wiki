# Do I use react / vue 
- advantages of using the frameworks
    - I learn something about the framework.
    - no boilerplate html - pages
        - It's not that bad because there are not many pages in this webapp
        - HTML - Elements can be injectes automatically with plain js
    - Data Binding
- disadvantages of using the frameworks
    - more overhead in the application.

## decission
first I start without react or vue.
